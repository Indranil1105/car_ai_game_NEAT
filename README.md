# ðŸ§  NEAT Car Racing AI ðŸš—

A self-learning car driving agent built using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. This project evolves a neural network from scratch to drive a car and dodge obstacles without any labeled data or pre-training â€” purely through trial, error, and evolution.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

This project simulates a 4-lane car racing game, where:

The player/AI must switch lanes to avoid crashing into enemy cars.
A neural network evolves using NEAT to learn survival strategies over generations.
Trained AI can consistently achieve scores above 500+, learning lane switching, reaction timing, and avoidance behavior.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

Component	Tech Used
Game Engine	Python + Pygame
AI Framework	NEAT-Python
Model Storage	Pickle
Visuals (WIP)	Matplotlib (fitness graph)
Inputs to Network	Lane position, distances to enemies, speed

## ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Simple and modular OOP-based code
âœ… Train your own AI or test the saved one
âœ… Dynamic enemy car spawning & difficulty scaling
âœ… Support for saving the best genome
âœ… Input features engineered for real-time decisions
âœ… 100% offline â€” no datasets required

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neat-car-racing-ai.git
cd neat-car-racing-ai

pip install pygame neat-python

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

âž¤ Human Mode:
Play manually using arrow keys.


python car_game.py
Move left/right with arrow keys

Try to survive as long as possible

## ðŸ§ª How to Train the AI

Make sure RUN_MODE is set to 'train' in car_game_ai.py
python car_game_ai.py
This will:

Evolve 100+ genomes per generation

Save the best genome as best_genome.pkl once fitness threshold is met

## ðŸ¤– How to Test the Trained AI bash

Make sure RUN_MODE is set to 'test' in car_game_ai.py
python car_game_ai.py
Watch the saved AI take full control of the car and dodge cars with precision!

## ðŸ§¬ What NEAT Does Internally

NEAT evolves neural networks by:

Starting with minimal networks (input â†’ output)

Assigning fitness based on game survival

Performing selection, crossover, and mutation

Gradually increasing complexity and performance over generations

No labeled data, no backpropagation, no gradient descent â€” just raw evolution.
